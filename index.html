        <h1>Somebody That I Used to Know</h1>
        <h2>Gotye</h2>
        <p>
            Now and then I think of when we were together<br>
            Like when you said you felt so happy you could die<br>
            Told myself that you were right for me<br>
            But felt so lonely in your company<br>
            But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness<br>
            Like resignation to the end, always the end<br>
            So when we found that we could not make sense<br>
            Well you said that we would still be friends<br>
            But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
        </p>
        <p>
            But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
            Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
            And I don't even need your love<br>
            But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br>
            No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
            Have your friends collect your records and then change your number<br>
            I guess that I don't need that though<br>
            Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
            Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
            Now you're just somebody that I used to know
        </p>
        <p>
            Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over<br>
            But had me believing it was always something that I'd done<br>
            But I don't wanna live that way<br>
            Reading into every word you say<br>
            You said that you could let it go<br>
            And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
        </p>
        <p>
            But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
            Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
            And I don't even need your love<br>
            But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br>
            No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
            Have your friends collect your records and then change your number<br>
            I guess that I don't need that though<br>
            Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
            Somebody (I used to know)<br>
            (Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
            Somebody (I used to know)<br>
            (Somebody) Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
            I used to know, that I used to know, I used to know somebody
